Paging

A memory management scheme that permits a process's physical address space to be non contiguous.
Which means to not share a common border or touch with in the address spaces.
When we use Paging we avoid the external fragmentation and the associate need for compation, there are two probelms that 
plague contiguous memory allocation.

Paging is implemented through cooperation between the operating system and the computer
hardware. 

Basic method for implementing paging involves breaking the physical memory into 
fixed sized blocks called frames and frames and breaking logical memory into 
blocks of the same size called pages. When a process is to be executed, its
pages are loaded into any available memoryframes from there source.
