Programming probelms

Assume that a system has a 32-bit virutal address with a 4 - KB page size
Write a C programm that is passed a virutal (in decimal)
on the command line and have it output the page number 
and offset for the given address. 

As an example, your program would run as follows:

./address 19986

Your program would output:

The address 19986 contains:
page number = 4
offset = 3602

Writing this program will require using the appropriate
data type to store 32 bits. We encourage you to use unsigned data 
types as well.
